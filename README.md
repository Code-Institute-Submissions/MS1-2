# Injectable Inc

---

#### User Centric Front End Development 

This website is created for a small business who offer non-surgical aesthetic procedures to enhance, or gain desirable features. The business offers Botox fillers to accentuate, define, or even smooth the appearance of facial features (Nose, Cheekbones, Jawline, and Lips). The fillers are injected by Injectable Inc’s own aesthetic professionals. My task at hand was to create a Front-End responsive website using HTML and CSS as basics, based on the principles of the user experience, accessibility, and responsivity. The framework I have used is based on bootstrap 4, there was an array of different concepts and design templates which made constructing the website simple. However, manipulating the basic structure, using CSS and some HTML got a bit tricky. I used inline styling, and also CSS styling to target specific elements  
of the project. I used the tutorials from Code Institute, I referred to Stack Overflow, W3schools a lot during the construction of Injectable Inc.

## UX
As a user I would want to feel an attraction and a buzz about the website,  
as changing any facial features you need to be confident that the person holding the needle,  
understands your vision of you. Having a website which appeals to you is the first representation of the business.  

### The colour scheme
The general colour scheme for the aesthetic industry is clinical. As Injectable Inc is a non-surgical cosmetic business,  
I felt it was appropriate to move away from that ‘white’ theme and dress the site with a theme that would appeal to our  
target audience (18-40yr olds). The fluid background I used from ‘shutterstock’ had a mix of hologram colours, which I  
considered to be modern and edgy. I felt that this mix of colours opened up many options for a block colour to be paired  
with. Originally i decided to use an opaque pink, but this caused issues with the mobile view drop down menu, as the  
writing wasn’t user friendly. I eventually chose a lilacy-pinky shade, I darkened the dept of the shade but still felt  
it was appropriate to give a marginal accent of opacity, to keep with the ‘fluid’ theme.
The pages linked to the index.html also display a splash of colour from the same icecream palette.  
I also used black for accent styling to add to the modern edge of the appearance.  
These black hyperlinked headings have a ‘hover’ property which reverts to pink upon selection.

### The walk through
The home page has a picture of a lady licking a lollypop, focusing the image on the regions the business offers services for such as the lips nose jaw and cheekbones; this holds a visual message for the user. There is a short inviting paragraph which pose questions to the user about their thoughts on themselves. By this point the users who know the procedures they would like to purchase, would click ‘enquire’ and register their interest on a pop-up form. 
The business logo sits on the left of the navbar which reminds the customer of the business name, and adds to the professional look of the site. On the right of the navbar there are 3 visible links ‘home’, ‘procedures’, and ‘contact us’. The procedures link drop’s down into a further 3 links for the areas the business offer services for (Lips, Nose, Cheekbone & Jawline Fillers). Each would take the user to the page specified for each procedure.
As the user scrolls down the home page they are presented with 3 images, which are each headed with the procedures and represent the regions of application: Lip, Nose, Jaw & Cheekbone Filler. A small footer gives a vague description of what each procedure does. The headings to each of these are also hyper linked to carry out the process the navbar would, making this a handy action when used on a mobile phone.
As the user scrolls further down they are met with an interactive gallery, which can be enlarged once clicked on. This showcases work of previous clients, and reinforces trust in the business as their portfolio of previous customers, and their procedures of ‘before and after’ images would score quiet highly especially if the user is planning on using a procedure to alter their face. 
Further down there are reviews from customers who have had procedures, and what they have to say about their experience. This reassures the user that the business has been trialled and tested, and is an opportunity for the business to show their customer service side of things, as having people skills goes a long way. The nature of the business is such that it may attract people who are self-conscious but are scared of needles; people who have a very low pain threshold, and people who just can’t visualise the results and need someone to share their concerns with. Knowing that you are being valued as a customer could be the tipping point of the customer making and enquiry.
There’s banner of 0% finance, which speaks to the customer directly, this opens up an option of buying into the product and paying later or in instalments, which eases the financial pressures of our target audience. students who want to look good, but cannot afford to; a special occasion the user wants to look good and have the confidence for, but don’t have the funds to pay for the procedure.
By this point, questions such as ‘how do I do this? What will happen after my enquiry? Will arise. The final paragraph is based on the customers journey from the moment they get in contact with the business, and the steps that follow. 
The final step on this page is the ‘call-to-action’ button, which would dial into the business.
Beneath this, for ongoing marketing purposes and further information for our user there are social media icons which are hyperlinked to each site. The user has the option to visit these and potentially follow the business on social media. From a client point of view, the business would earn exposure from users following them and their contacts being able to view Injectable Inc’s posts, in effect having a ripple effect on following. 

### WireFrames
Wireframes were created using [Balsamiq Mockups 3](/assets/mockups/Wireframes.png)- this allowed me to create a computer and a mobile based design. The mobile design doesn’t differ much from the computer-based design, apart from reduced content which gives the user the important content, in a simple and easy to read manner.

## Features
For consistency I have kept the footer and the header the same across the pages, the index page requires scrolling down to, but the other pages contain just the right amount of information for both the header and footer to be visible. Hover elements have been added to the hyperlinked aspects, I have chosen to use the ‘buzz’ of buttons to create an element of excitement, and to go with the theme of being ‘fun’. The larger button at the bottom was too big to set to buzz, as it made the page look messy and that there was too much going on. I countered this with a vertical wobble; staying within a reasonably similar visual design as the buzz, making the page look neater and in control.

### Index.html
The use of a modal with a form, which is linked to the enquiry button as the first visual page, along with another call-to-action modal activated with a button above the footer. Both modals were taken from Bootstrap4 templates, and customised to suit the website needs, and design. The use of these modals simplifies the process of the user getting in contact with the business, and encourages them to do so as the buttons have suitably been placed at the start and the end of the index page, and visably fixed at the bottom of each page they wish to read more upon.
I have used fancyBox.com to allow my gallery images to opens up to a whole page, adding a dark overlay on the whole page, allowing the focus on the centralised and enlarged image the user had clicked on. This allows the customer a more focused and closer look at the images.

### Lip-filler.html, Cheekjaw-filler.html, Nose-filler.html, contact-us.html
These pages were created to hold further information on a procedures the users are interested in. For ease of use, and to maximise the UX I wrapped the button and the footer and gave it a element of ‘fixed-bottom’, so the footer and the button would hold their position on the screen. If the user decided that the procedure is for them, they are able to get in contact immediately with just one click Call Now (call-to-action) button.

### Features left to implement 
For the mobile version of this page I used @media query (display: none) to hide the image, I found that this gave the mobile version a stream-lined and a neater finish. Leaving the page to give the information it needs to. However, I would ideally like to tie up the back end of the enquiry form, and possibly add a video of each procedure taking place in the business on the specified pages. I believe this would enhance our users experience, and educate them visually, as an aide to using just text.

## Technologies used
Languages:
HTML- hypertext markup language- used to build basic structure of a website.
CSS- cascading style sheets- used to style HTML
Bootstrap4- HTML CSS JS library 
JQuery- implemented in the templates used from fancy box

Google Fonts- used to apply the style of font choice (Raleway)

---

## Testing:
[HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) check- complete 
script type=”text/javascript
 appeared as a unnecessary JS resource- however this was interlinked with Fancybox’s JS script.
Aria label also flagged up in the modal template used for the ‘Call Now’ button.
Font Awesome cdn link attribute was also flagged up as bad practice. 
[CSS validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator) check complete
-webkit-background-size, -moz-background-size, -o-background-size all appeared as ‘unknown vendor extensions’.

### My Findings
I have found in Chrome the website appears to be smaller, so it appears to be zoomed out in comparison to Explorer. The text and the image formatting is much larger in size.
Whilst testing the site, I found that Devtools gave different size, spacing and format compared to the true rendering images on an actual phone. I originally though it maybe appealing to have a picture sit on top of the information on the procedure pages, but this made the page look messy in reality compared to what DevTools was displaying. I made a decision to make it clean cut and deliver the essential snippet of information a user would e looking for in a easy to read way, without having to scroll so much.
